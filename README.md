# MordorSH - A Lord of The Rings Inspired UNIX Shell

MordorSH is a UNIX shell written in C, inspired by the world of **Lord of The Rings**. This shell simulates a basic command-line environment with essential UNIX functionalities, all while paying homage to the iconic fantasy universe.

**Created by:** [TahmidRaven](https://github.com/TahmidRaven)

## Features

MordorSH supports the following features, making it a reliable tool for all your UNIX-based adventures in Middle-earth:

- **Neofetch**: Type `neofetch` to display system information, akin to the maps detailing your journey through Middle-earth.
- **Command Execution**: Execute any valid system command (e.g., `mkdir`, `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `echo`, etc.), just like a hobbit navigating the Shire.
- **Ctrl+C**: Interrupt the current command with a powerful, magical force — akin to throwing the One Ring into Mount Doom.
- **Exit**: Type `exit` to leave the shell, much like leaving the fellowship.
- **Clear**: Type `clear` to rid the terminal of unwanted clutter, similar to clearing the dark clouds over Mordor.
- **Command History**: Use the **up** and **down** arrows to navigate through past commands, like retracing your steps on a perilous journey.
- **Command History Display**: Type `history` to show all commands previously executed — your trail through the lands of Middle-earth.
- **Redirection**:
  - **Input Redirection**: `command < input.txt` - Direct your input as though you're passing instructions to the Council of Elrond.
  - **Output Redirection**: `command > output.txt` - Redirect the output as if sending messages via the Eagles.
  - **Append Output**: `command >> output.txt` - Append your message, like adding to a legend passed through the ages.
- **Piping**: `command1 | command2` - Pipe the output of one command to another, as if sending a message from Rivendell to Gondor.
- **Command Sequencing**: `command1 ; command2` - Execute commands in sequence, like events unfolding on the path to Mount Doom.
- **Conditional (AND)**: `command1 && command2` - Run the second command only if the first one is successful, akin to the fellowship's reliance on each other.
- **Manual Page**: Type `man` to display the shell's manual, a guide to navigating the realms of MordorSH.
